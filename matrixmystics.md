# Module 1

1. Plot the lines $$y=x$$, $$y=2x$$, $$y=10x$$.

2. Observe that they all pass through the origin. Why?

3. Plot $$y=2x+1$$. Why doesn't it pass through the origin?

4. Plot $$y=ax+b$$, with $$a$$ and $b$ as parameters which you should be able to varry. What do youaa observe?

5. Consider the following simultaneous equation:

   2x+3y=7 <br>
   3x+4y=10 <br>

   Do you see a 2x2 matrix here? What is the importance of seeing a matrix in this problem? Why study matrices in general?<br>Do you observe that this problem can be retold as: <br>$$ \left( \begin{matrix} 2 & 3 \\3 & 4 \\\end{matrix}\right) $$
   $$\left(
   \begin{matrix}
   x\\
   y\\
   \end{matrix}
   \right)$$
   =$$\left(
   \begin{matrix}
   7\\
   10\\
   \end{matrix}
   \right)$$

6. Do you know what is $$\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^2 and \mathbb{R}^3$$ ? 

7. Consider a simple function $$f(x) = 3x+2$$. This function is invertible right? Can you tell us what is $$\alpha$$ such that $$f(\alpha)=17? Is such an $$\alpha$$ unique? How did you find such an $$\alpha?$$. Is this always possible?

8. Consider the function $$\phi : \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$$ defined by $$\phi (x,y)=(2x+3y,3x+4y)$$. What has this to do with the previous question?

9. Is the function $$\phi$$ invertible? In the question above on matrices, we see that it is of the form $$Ax=b$$. Note that we can invert the matrix, using the method that was taught to us in our high school to find out the value for the variables x and y. This is one of the many applications of matrices.

10. We will now see matrices as functions. Instead of $$\phi$$ we will write the matrix itself: <br>$$\left( \begin{matrix} 2 & 3 \\3 & 4 \\\end{matrix}\right) : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$$. 

11. Consider the function $$\left( \begin{matrix} 1 & 2 \\2 & 4 \\\end{matrix}\right) : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$$. This matrix takes a few elements to the origin. What are those elements? Plot this using Geogebra.

1\. We encounter equations very often in our lives. Consider for example, the following situation at ___Baker's Cafe___. The manager has a very important estimate to make. Mostly, visitors at his cafe happen to be families and they are often comprised of Children and/or Adults. He observes that there are 3 adults and 1 child at a table and their bill turns out to be Rs.1200/-. There is yet another table with 2 children and 1 adult and their bill comes out to be Rs.1000/-. Can the manager estimate the consumption of a Child/Adult? This is popularly called the _Simultaneous Equations_ and we all remember from our school days, multiple ways in which these can be solved.<br>
$$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
$$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$

2\. While we were taught the so called two variables and two unknowns, what if there were more equations than unknowns?<br>
$$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
$$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$    
$$ 1A + 1C =  900 $$


3\. Note that the previous question can be modelled as a matrix:

   $$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
   $$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$    
   $$ 1A + 1C =  900 $$

   <u>Observe</u> this is same as :

   $$ \left( \begin{matrix} 3 & 1 \\1 & 2 \\1 & 1 \\\end{matrix}\right) $$
   $$\left(
   \begin{matrix}
   B\\
   C\\
   \end{matrix}
   \right)$$
   =
$$
   \left(
	\begin{matrix}
	1200\\
	1000\\
	900\\
	\end{matrix}
   \right)
$$

4\. one obvious way to solve this, is to guess the values :-). Can you get closer to the solution by guessing? Note that there is no solution to this question. You can just reduce the error. 

5\. How do you solve this mathematically? There are two nice ways of solving this:   

 - Model this as a question of inverting a rectangular matrix and find the solution. (Whoa! my teacher never taught me that!). 
 - Model this as a funtion of two variables and solve it using partial differentiation (Eeks!).<br>

 This is out of the scope of our discussions so far. We will slowly reach a stage when we develop our understanding of matrices to an extent that the answer to this qustion is a natural consequence of a bunch of topics. For now, keep this in your list of I-dont-understand topics.
