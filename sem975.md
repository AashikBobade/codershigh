1. This is an initiative comprising of 6 students.
2. We call this *Semester 9 three quarters*.
3. We all know that $$(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2+2ab$$
4. We all know that The binomial theorem states that for any real numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and any non-negative integer \( n \):

\[ (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k \]

where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, given by:

\[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]

Here, \( n! \) represents the factorial of \( n \), which is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).
