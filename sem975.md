1. This is an initiative comprising of 6 students.
2. We call this *Semester 9 three quarters*.
3. We all know that $$(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2+2ab$$
4. We all know that The binomial theorem states that for any real numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and any non-negative integer \( n \):

$$ (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$$
